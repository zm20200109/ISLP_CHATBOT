The formula is given by: Formula -> The approximation of the function f-bag of x is equal to one over B multiplied by the sum from b equals one to B of the function f-star-hat of b of x.
"What is the formula for calculating the cross-validated error (CV) in the context of k-Fold Cross-Validation (CV), where the mean squared error (MSE) is averaged over k folds?",The formula for calculating the coefficient of variation (CV) for k-Fold Cross-Validation (CV) in machine learning is given by: Formula -> CV sub k equals 1 over k times the sum from i equals 1 to g of MSE.
